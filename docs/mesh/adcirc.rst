ADCIRC Meshes
=============

`ADCIRC <https://adcirc.org/>`_ solves time-dependent transport and circulation
problems in two and three dimensions. These problems are solved on a highly
flexible, unstructured triangular mesh. In PYOPATRA, we use output from ADCIRC
to inform our ocean model that particles flow through.
